          <p>I recently finished the web development immersive course at General Assembly. I chose web development because it gave me what I have been looking for, the combination of creativity and problem solving. I want to make great applications that have fantastic user interfaces and great functionality. I’m currently seeking a position in a dynamic environment with people who can help me realise my development ambitions. </p>

          <h2 class="w3-text-grey w3-padding-16"><i class="fa fa-suitcase fa-fw w3-margin-right w3-xxlarge w3-text-teal"></i>Work Experience</h2>
          <p>In the UK I worked for waitrose as a delivery driver around oxford. I did office work after that for a company which involved sorting out their computer problems so they could communicate with truck drivers effectively. I set up a tablet system that had forms designed on them from the microsoft suite. The truck drivers could enter all the information needed for a particular job while there. This would then be sent back to the office where the information could be uploaded to a database and aid decision making. It took about four months to integrate this system, there where many levels to it.<br><br>

            I have a passion for traveling and other countries is where most of my work experience comes from. I spent eighteen months in Australia from the middle of 2015 to the end of 2016 where I experienced many different jobs from construction, sales and hospitality. It’s changed me as a person being involved in these rich and different situations. I have met many interesting people in different situations. I found construction particularly fun for this because you got to be outside in the beautiful Australian sun with friends. Although these chapters have given me insight into communication and people, I was still searching for my calling.<br><br>

            I came back from Australia at the end of 2016 and stated working in a local pub to supplement my savings in preparation for my GA course. There was a lot of dedication in this job because I was aiming towards a great desire of learning web development.

          <p>Project One:
            <br>
            My first project was a game, a version of whack-a-mole. I found the the project fascinating because you have to think in many directions at once and at different places in time. This kind of parallel thinking was addictive because it showed me the beauty of intuitive connections and powerful abstractions. You can create a finer nuance in your thinking which makes you a better thinker. My project was structured around a square grid with parts of the grid that would light up at different points and before they went you had to click on them. If you failed to click them before their coloured state had vanished you would lose a life, you only have three lifes.
            <br><br>
            Project Two:
            <br>
            I love landscapes and the expanse of nature, I often end up looking at pictures by other people. This gave me inspiration for my second project. I decided to make a website where people could go and upload pictures of nature. I made it specific to Scandinavia because it made it less general and some of the most beautiful places in the world are there, Specifically I chose Norway. Using pictures as the main feature of an application gives you great opportunity to create a minimalist and balanced layout around the picture. I used bootstrap for the design and structure. This introduced me to the efficiency of using css frameworks, you learn a lot about css by understanding about how the creators have used css to create the framework you are using by adjusting it to your specifications you can learn this in a deep way.
            <br><br>
            Project Three:
            <br>
            This was a group project. We made a text to speech app using the IBM computer Watson. What we did was to upload a text file to the application that was then pushed to Watson, converted by Watson and sent back to our app so it could be played. This was quite a technical challenge we had to overcome because there were many variables to think about and different collective functionality as well. I learnt so much from the rest of the group who all had great team spirit and where willing to help other people out. What became of this opportunity was how to think of problems in different ways.
            <br><br>
            Project Four:
            <br>
            I created a website where people could go and start events and where other people could join with similar interests but with a twist. You had to qualify your interest to the event creator, this ensured that the quality of the event was high and the aim was far more likely to be achieved. For example if I was to create an event about 1980’s jazz I would want to have an enriching discussion about this subject which means people having the same aims as me. This is achieved by people only being accepted to the event by demonstrating their knowledge of the subject to the group creator. The group creator can then accept or decline.

          <p>I love trying to think of interesting solutions to puzzles and problems. It feels really good when you suddenly get an insight into a situation which then changes your thinking about all other related problems. This is what has attracted me to programming in the first place, the opportunity to apply this thinking to a practical domain. I like to find this in my other interests which mainly consists of reading about science, having fun with friends, trying to play some guitar and doing some maths.</p>
